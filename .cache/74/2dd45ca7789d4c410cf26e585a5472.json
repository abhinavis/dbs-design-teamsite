Researchers who fear no one. A room full of directors, vice presidents or even real presidents? No problem! They stand up and speak up for what our customers need.<br><br>\n                    \n                    You and your team will keep us on our toes. You will keep asking, 'Why are we doing this again?'. And not be satisfied with the answer, 'If we build it, they will come’.<br><br>\n                    \n                    <b>Here's what your week might look like</b><br><br>\n                    \n                    - We are a big company with a lot of stakeholders and we are shifting to agile development. So whether you need to conduct usability research or workshop with stakeholders to redefine the problem statement, you'll be doing a fair amount of planning and prioritising each week.<br><br>\n                    \n                    - Not everything has to be tested. You will identify when research is required and when best practices are the way to go. And you will help us communicate that to our stakeholders.<br><br>\n                    \n                    - You will help build a research practice that is scalable to different business units (e.g. consumer banking, institutional banking, enterprise) and countries. You will help create research ops (e.g. tools & templates, processes, guidelines) that helps the entire design team to make research a team sport.<br><br>\n                    \n                    - You will roll up your sleeves every now and then and conduct field research: qualitative and quantitative research. We've done some interesting stuff: diary study (we got people to log all their payments and write about each), Ethnography (observe how small merchants are coping with digital payments) and others. In short, we love to experiment and hope you will create opportunities for the team to continue to do so.<br><br>\n                    \n                    - You will help your team of researchers to create sharp and concise reports full of actionable findings. Their reports will be things of beauty that will inspire your colleagues to truly start seeing through the eyes of our customers.<br><br>\n                    \n                    - UX is a pretty established discipline here at DBS [(thanks to one person especially](https://medium.com/dbs-bank-design/building-your-companys-first-in-house-design-team-af1d375d4bcb)), but we can always use help to evangelise the importance of good UX Research, and how, just because it has the word 'research' in it, it doesn't take months!<br><br>\n                    \n                    Here are the experience and skills we'd love you to have<br><br>\n                    \n                    - You have 10+ years of relevant experience.\n                    - You’ve managed team of researchers or designers before and nurtured them to deliver quality work.\n                    - You’ve experience working with cross-functional teams (e.g. data, design, business, marketing)\n                    - You've had hands-on involvement with an end-to-end research process.\n                    - You have a working knowledge of qualitative and quantitative data analyses, usability testing, eye tracking, card sorting, survey evaluation, A/B and multivariate testing and heuristic evaluations.\n                    - You can filter out noise to uncover actionable insights. In our experience, people who are organised, methodical and analytical are very good at this.\n                    - You have working knowledge of data-logging tools such as Morae and Tobii, etc.\n                    - You are an eloquent public speaker and an accomplished report-writer.\n                    - You are an empathic human being with interest in psychology, anthropology, human-computer interaction, cognitive science and business.<br><br>\n                    \n                    <b>Bonus points</b><br><br>\n                    \n                    - You have experience in the fintech industry.\n                    - You've been a designer yourself (or have some design experience). We find that it really helps when working with designers.\n                    - You are a 'best practice junkie' and have a treasure trove of usability research around the best design pattern to use.\n                    - You're kind of a behavioural science geek.<br><br>\n                    \n                    <b>Your team and career</b><br><br>\n                    \n                    You will report directly to our Chief Design Officer.<br><br>\n                    \n                    You will manage and lead a team of 8 User Researchers.<br><br>\n                    \n                    Beyond Digital User Research, there is scope to grow the research team within the offline space, to formulate a much richer picture of the end to end customer journey.<br><br>\n                    \n                    <b>About DBS</b><br><br>\n                    \n                    DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia. We are headquartered in Singapore, with a growing presence in Greater China, Southeast Asia and South Asia.<br><br>\n                    \n                    We were named the Best Bank in the World by Global Finance in August 2018—the first Singapore and Asian bank to receive this honour.<br><br>\n                    \n                    We want our customers to **Live more, Bank less.** And we want to **make banking invisible.**<br><br>\n                    \n                    Every day, there’s a lot more to explore, experience and enjoy—and a lot less time to do it in. That’s why we’ve created banking that’s fast, natural, effortless. Banking that’s with you wherever life takes you, instead of taking you away from life. So you can enjoy a lot more life, with a lot less bank.<br><br>\n                    \n                    About the design team<br><br>\n                    \n                    Hi, we are the DBS user experience design team<br><br>\n                    \n                    We create digital products that deserve to be built because they solve real problems in an impactful way with empathy.<br><br>\n                    \n                    How we design<br><br>\n                    \n                    We go beyond numbers<br><br>\n                    \n                    Every dollar means something. No one actually wants money. We want what it can give us. So we acknowledge that money is not really about money. We inject emotion into our products to go from transactional to magical.<br><br>\n                    \n                    We have one profound idea<br><br>\n                    \n                    Because ambiguity is the enemy of good user experience.

                <div class="section-desc">In 2014 we had two designers. Fast-forward to 2020 and there are more than 60 of us. We’ve gone from wearing banker-like suits (and feeling very uncomfortable) to jeans and t-shirts, winning the ‘war’ in using Macs and having a design studio in our office. We've truly infiltrated the world of banking.
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                Our strategy has always been simple — deliver high quality work to help other teams understand the value of design.
                <p>&nbsp;</p>       
                We are not brilliant jerks and moody superstars. We are get s*** done people. We are a team that perseveres, commits to long-term goals and delivers real business value.</div>

                        We can do that when we work together in a deliberate, consistent way. The result is a coherent experience, both for our customers and internal stakeholders.
                        
                        This doesn't mean we're all the same: the band needs different instruments to sound interesting.</p>

                <p class="value-desc">We're building something new, and that's never easy. We know that success takes hard work, and we have the patience to see things through. 

                        It's also important to strike a balance. Sometimes we need to pick our battles, and that's okay, too.</p>

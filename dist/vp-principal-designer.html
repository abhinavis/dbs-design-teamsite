                <div class="role-content-what">
                    <h4>What you'll be doing</h4>
                    <p class="role-content-body">We have a large and complex product ecosystem spanning 8 countries and a team of 60 people from 15 different countries. Both need a visionary, decisive Principal Designer to lead the way and lead by example, hands-on. What's more, you will evangelise the importance and impact of design and take calculated risks with all eyes on you. So, yes, we are looking for an almost mythical creature.</p>

                            <li>Speaking of the big picture, we need your help on UX strategy. You'll look at user needs, business requirements, competitive forces and trends and perform gap analysis.</li><br>

                            <li>Exploring and creating new patterns for our DLS will be an important part of your work. Juggling hands-on work with mentoring can be hard. We know that, and we're always trying to improve the way we work, such as having no-meeting days and enabling people to spend a percentage of their time on passion projects.</li><br>

                            <li>We want to encourage our team to share their work more, and we would love you to lead some of those sessions.</li><br>

                            <li>You will also need to engage in design reviews at the executive level, guiding our stakeholders so that the feedback we get is about the problems, not solutions.</li><br>

                            <li>We have a large, still-growing team, so we love good processes and effective tools that enable us to work smarter. We want your ideas on how we can work faster and smarter.</li><br>

                            <li>You can talk confidently and clearly about design and build lasting relationships with our stakeholders.</li><br>

                            DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia. We are headquartered in Singapore, with a growing presence in Greater China, Southeast Asia and South Asia. <br><br>

We were named the Best Bank in the World by Global Finance in August 2018—the first Singapore and Asian bank to receive this honour.<br><br>

We want our customers to <b>Live more, Bank less</b> and we want to <b>make banking invisible.</b>

Every day, there’s a lot more to explore, experience and enjoy—and a lot less time to do it in. That’s why we’ve created banking that’s fast, natural, effortless. Banking that’s with you wherever life takes you, instead of taking you away from life. So you can enjoy a lot more life, with a lot less bank.

                    <p class="role-content-body">Your job will be to build and nurture a fearless, amazing team of researchers. Researchers who fear no one. A room full of directors, vice presidents or even real presidents? No problem! They stand up and speak up for what our customers need.<br><br>

                        You and your team will keep us on our toes. You will keep asking, 'Why are we doing this again?'. And not be satisfied with the answer, 'If we build it, they will come’.</p>

So whether you need to conduct usability research or workshop with stakeholders to redefine the problem statement, you'll be doing a fair amount of planning and prioritising each week.</li><br>

                            <li>Not everything has to be tested. You will identify when research is required and when best practices are the way to go. And you will help us communicate that to our stakeholders.</li><br>

                            <li>You will help build a research practice that is scalable to different business units (e.g. consumer banking, institutional banking, enterprise) and countries. You will help create research ops (e.g. tools & templates, processes, guidelines) that helps the entire design team to make research a team sport.</li><br>

                            <li>You will roll up your sleeves every now and then and conduct field research: qualitative and quantitative research. We've done some interesting stuff: diary study (we got people to log all their payments and write about each), Ethnography (observe how small merchants are coping with digital payments) and others. In short, we love to experiment and hope you will create opportunities for the team to continue to do so.</li><br>

                            DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia. We are headquartered in Singapore, with a growing presence in Greater China, Southeast Asia and South Asia. <br><br>

We were named the Best Bank in the World by Global Finance in August 2018—the first Singapore and Asian bank to receive this honour.<br><br>

We want our customers to <b>Live more, Bank less</b> and we want to <b>make banking invisible.</b>

Every day, there’s a lot more to explore, experience and enjoy—and a lot less time to do it in. That’s why we’ve created banking that’s fast, natural, effortless. Banking that’s with you wherever life takes you, instead of taking you away from life. So you can enjoy a lot more life, with a lot less bank.

                            <li>You'll do some competitive research online.</li><br>

                            <li>You'll analyse data and make data-driven content decisions.</li><br>

                            <li>You'll open Sketch, go through the design flow and create your first draft.</li><br>

                            <li>You'll also jot down a bunch of questions and ideas.</li><br>

                            <li>Then come the emails and meetings. You'll need to keep up with and summarise the feedback from various stakeholders and follow up to make sure you get the answers you need.</li><br>

                            <li>From time to time, you will run content workshops for our product owners. You will help them apply our content guidelines and content design principles to their products.</li><br>

                            <li>To make sure your content sees the light of day, you'll need to do some grunt work—updating Sketch files and content management systems, participating in demos and checking staging apps.</li><br>

                            <li>Don't like grunt work? Good, neither do we, so we're constantly trying to improve our tools and processes to make sure we have less of it to do. And we want you to contribute.</li><br>

                            <li>This role is regional, so you'll get to work with fantastic people from all over the region.</li><br>

                            This role sits within the Design Standards team, and is based in Singapore. The Design Standards team creates our design language system and defines and steers the way we design digital services at DBS. The team covers eight countries, Consumer and Corporate banking, and Middle Office Management group (internal tools).<br><br>

                            Content design is a new discipline at DBS, and you will have a lot of opportunities to define the role UX writers play in the design process.

                    <p class="role-content-body">
                            DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia. We are headquartered in Singapore, with a growing presence in Greater China, Southeast Asia and South Asia. <br><br>

We were named the Best Bank in the World by Global Finance in August 2018—the first Singapore and Asian bank to receive this honour.<br><br>

We want our customers to <b>Live more, Bank less</b> and we want to <b>make banking invisible.</b>

Every day, there’s a lot more to explore, experience and enjoy—and a lot less time to do it in. That’s why we’ve created banking that’s fast, natural, effortless. Banking that’s with you wherever life takes you, instead of taking you away from life. So you can enjoy a lot more life, with a lot less bank.

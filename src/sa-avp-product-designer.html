              You'll spend most of your time trying to simplify very complex
              products and ideas. It may be an uphill battle, but it's worth it.

            <ul class="pointers">
              <li>
                You'll spend time with our talented designers. Together you'll try to understand the business goals of the projects and, more often than not, meet the stakeholders to redefine the problem statement.
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                Design standard is not always about component and guidelines. You will be working closely with product designers to come up with solutions that solve business problems.
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                We want to hire people who have opinions, believe in their ideas and are willing to fight for them. But we also want people who can recognise when a better argument or solution is put before them. All of us participate in user testing, and so will you.
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                Like we said, producing good work is not good enough if it
                doesn't get built. We love you, Dribble/Behance. It's not you,
                it's us. You will meet stakeholders from different departments
                and articulate your ideas so clearly that you'll become an
                honorary Toastmaster.
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                To prepare for those meetings you'll need to check the latest
                relevant data.

                Before you know it, it will be Friday and time for team dinner,

              <li>
                You follow through—when built, your designs actually look and work like they should. You monitor products after launch and are ready to suggest improvements.

            <p class="role-content-body">
              DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia. We are
              headquartered in Singapore, with a growing presence in Greater
              China, Southeast Asia and South Asia. <br /><br />

              We were named the Best Bank in the World by Global Finance in
              August 2018—the first Singapore and Asian bank to receive this
              honour.<br /><br />

              We want our customers to <b>Live more, Bank less</b> and we want
              to <b>make banking invisible.</b>

              Every day, there’s a lot more to explore, experience and enjoy—and
              a lot less time to do it in. That’s why we’ve created banking
              that’s fast, natural, effortless. Banking that’s with you wherever
              life takes you, instead of taking you away from life. So you can
              enjoy a lot more life, with a lot less bank.

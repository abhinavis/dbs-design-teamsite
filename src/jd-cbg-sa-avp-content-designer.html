            <h4>Here's what your week might look like</h4>
            <ul class="pointers">
              <li>You'll spend time with product designers, researchers, and business owners to understand the goals of a new feature or the re-design of an old one.</li>
              <li>You'll do some competitive research online.</li>
              <li>You'll analyse data and make data-driven content decisions.</li>
              <li>You'll open Figma, go through the design flow and create your first draft.</li>
              <li>You'll also jot down a bunch of questions and ideas.</li>
              <li>Then come the emails and meetings. You'll need to keep up with and summarise the feedback from various stakeholders and follow up to make sure you get the answers you need.</li>
              <li>To make sure your content sees the light of day, you'll need to do some grunt work—updating Figma files and content management systems, participating in demos and checking staging apps.</li>
              <li>Don't like grunt work? Good, neither do we, so we're constantly trying to improve our processes to make sure we have less of it to do. You'll be welcome to contribute!</li>
              <li>This role is regional, so you'll get to work with fantastic people from all over the region. The content you'll create will need to be internationalised and localised. Sometimes, you'll need to make changes to the source content to ensure it makes sense for another country.</li>
              <li>To summarise, you'll own the customer journey from a copy perspective and make sure there are no gaps in UX across all channels and touchpoints linked to the products.</li>

                            <li>As a cherished member of the Design Standards team, working to standardise products across six countries, you'll start and end your week with the DLS we are building.</li><br>

                            <li>The DLS work may take you to India, Taiwan or the other countries where many of our developers are stationed. You'll be our ambassador on the tech side, performing coding governance and making sure designers and developers are on the same page.</li><br>

                            <li>A DLS is as (or almost as) good as the tools that support it. Strict bank security policies and SAAS tools often don't go together, but we are making this work. For example, we've invested in implementing Abstract. And with you by our side, helping us choose the right tools, we'll be unstoppable!</li><br>

                            <li>You will spend time with our various teams understanding the products and projects they are rooting for and evaluating if or prototypes should be built. You will work especially closely with our wonderful research team.</li><br>

                            <li>It's important to us that we contribute to the wider design community (through events, articles, internships, etc.). We need to build and maintain a website to share ideas, and we hope you can help us with that. It's for designers, so we want all your crazy and beautiful ideas on how to make it special.</li><br>

                            DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia. We are headquartered in Singapore, with a growing presence in Greater China, Southeast Asia and South Asia. <br><br>

We were named the Best Bank in the World by Global Finance in August 2018—the first Singapore and Asian bank to receive this honour.<br><br>

We want our customers to <b>Live more, Bank less</b> and we want to <b>make banking invisible.</b>

Every day, there’s a lot more to explore, experience and enjoy—and a lot less time to do it in. That’s why we’ve created banking that’s fast, natural, effortless. Banking that’s with you wherever life takes you, instead of taking you away from life. So you can enjoy a lot more life, with a lot less bank.

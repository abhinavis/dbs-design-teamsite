              <h3>
                What do you enjoy about being on the team?
              </h3>
              <p>
                When you join DBS Group Design, you don’t just join a team of collaborative and critical thinkers. You become a crucial player in a movement to elevate the way people approach and manage their finances digitally. I really appreciate the opportunities to think critically when crafting (fun)ctional content for our customers so they don’t have to agonise over their money.
              </p>
              <p>
                You’ll see that a lot of other stories mention people as the main source of joy, and there really couldn’t be a more accurate answer than that. I love how coordinated and random we can be: coordinated in our ability to focus on a problem and work out a solution together; random in our desire to connect and grow with each other during and outside of work.
              </p>
              <h3>
                What energises you at work?
              </h3>
              <p>
                I’m energised when people thank me for helping them communicate in a better, more effective way.
              </p>
              <p>
                Yes, I know, it’s like patting yourself on the back. But it truly makes a difference when you feel appreciated and you know you’re adding value to the team and project. Neilson had a more wholesome way of putting this when I spoke to him a while ago (about something else, but you get my earlier point about being random. And do check out his story): achieving a small feat is important as positive feedback to keep me going.
              </p>
              <p>
                I guess it’s also knowing the work I do gets translated into “real life” which I rarely encountered in my previous roles, like customers reading that one sentence I spent hours thinking about and chipped several nails for, and continuing on a particular product journey to completion instead of dropping off. This is the kind of success metric we dream about all the time, and even the prospect of it alone is enough to energise me at work every day.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Share a nugget or two about a day in your job?
              </h3>
              <p>
                You’d think I’d spend the majority of my day typing out content for screens as a Content Designer, but the reality is I’m 80% mulling over the content strategy for a particular flow, 25% actually typing, and 5% seeking reassurance from Google on whether I used the right grammar or word. The math doesn’t add up and I certainly wasn’t hired for my mental sums ability, but that’s not a miscalculation: being a part of this team makes me want to put in more than 100%.
              </p>
              <p>
                The “Backspace” key is the MVP on my laptop. Self-doubt is the first step to perfection — you heard it here first.

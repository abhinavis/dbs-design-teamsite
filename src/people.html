We’ve gone from wearing banker-like suits (and feeling very uncomfortable) to jeans and t-shirts, winning the ‘war’ in using Macs and having a design studio in our office. We've truly infiltrated the world of banking.
                <br><br>
                Our strategy has always been simple — deliver high quality work to help other teams understand the value of design.
                <br><br>     
                We are not brilliant jerks and moody superstars. We are get s*** done people. We are a team that perseveres, commits to long-term goals and delivers real business value.</p>

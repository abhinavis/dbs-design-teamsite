            The Product Designers we really want to hire deliver real value to
            real users. In other words, they design stuff that gets built.

              You'll spend most of your time trying to simplify very complex
              products and ideas. It may be an uphill battle, but it's worth it.
              If you succeed, your designs will be experienced by millions and
              solve real-life problems. We say that, if you can work in a bank,

            <ul class="pointers">
              <li>
                You will work closely with Team Lead to design and grow small team of designers working various projects under digital channels across different platform and markets. DIGITAL team taking care of several digital channels that consist of digibank, internet banking, public website, help & support, intelligent banking and few other projects.
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                You'll spend time with our wonderful research team. Together you'll try to understand the business goals of your project and, more often than not, meet the stakeholders to redefine the problem statement.
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                We want to hire people who have opinions, believe in their ideas
                and are willing to fight for them. But we also want people who
                can recognise when a better argument or solution is put before
                them. All of us participate in user testing, and so will you.
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                Like we said, producing good work is not good enough if it
                doesn't get built. We love you, Dribble/Behance. It's not you,
                it's us. You will meet stakeholders from different departments
                and articulate your ideas so clearly that you'll become an
                honorary Toastmaster.
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                To prepare for those meetings you'll need to check the latest
                relevant data.
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                Before you know it, it will be Friday and time for team dinner,

            <ul class="pointers">
              <li>
                You have 5-8+ years of experience in UI / UX Design. You are experienced in designing product across different platforms and care on creating holistic experience. You think in ecosystems and not just in products or features.
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                You are thoughtful in your design. You can take broad and ambiguous problems and turn into delightful solution. You will spend time to understand define the problem before jumping into figma to start designing.
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                You are a team player and great at collaborating. You are comfortable to brainstorm and work with other designer(s).
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                You are a master of your craft. You pay attention to details and know when to zoom in and zoom out.
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                You have the ability to prioritise (you don't focus on illustrations if the UX looks like a love child between Frankenstein and Krusty the Clown).
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                You have confidence in your ideas and able to bring stakeholders and convince your idea clearly.
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                You follow through-when built, your designs actually look and work like they should. You monitor products after launch and are ready to suggest improvements.
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                You have enough curiosity to stay savvy about industry and UX trends.
              </li>

              DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia. We are
              headquartered in Singapore, with a growing presence in Greater
              China, Southeast Asia and South Asia. <br /><br />

              We were named the Best Bank in the World by Global Finance in
              August 2018—the first Singapore and Asian bank to receive this
              honour.<br /><br />

              We want our customers to <b>Live more, Bank less</b> and we want
              to <b>make banking invisible.</b>

              Every day, there’s a lot more to explore, experience and enjoy—and
              a lot less time to do it in. That’s why we’ve created banking
              that’s fast, natural, effortless. Banking that’s with you wherever
              life takes you, instead of taking you away from life. So you can
              enjoy a lot more life, with a lot less bank.

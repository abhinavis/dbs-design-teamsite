              You will collaborate closely with developers, UX designers, content designers, business owners, and quality assurance team to make sure the content DBS customers see on our apps is up to date and translated. This is a great role for anyone interested in learning about digital product design and development.

                You will collaborate closely with developers, UX designers, content designers, business owners, and quality assurance team to make sure the content DBS customers see on our apps is up to date and translated. This is a great role for anyone interested in learning about digital product design and development.
                <ul>
                  <li>We don't expect you to be a writer or a translator yourself. If you can read Simplified and Traditional Chinese, that's great! But not absolutely necessary.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                To keep up with the various projects you are supporting, you will attend sprint planning meetings and retrospectives.
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                Sometimes, there will be bugs. Not the flying, itchy kind, but the kind that causes apps to malfunction. When those bugs are related to content our users see, you will work with the team to get them sorted out.
                <ul>
                  <li>Don't worry, you don't need to be a developer. This is not a technical role. It's about project management. What matters is that you are cool with learning to use new tools and interested in digital product development and UX design.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                Digital products don't stand still. What was good yesterday is not good enough today. So we constantly keep improving our apps. Part of that is to update the content our customers see, and we need your help with that. You will project manage the content update release process to make sure stuff goes out on time and as it was intended!
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, we want you to keep suggesting ways to improve our  localisation and content management workflow. Ideas on how to reduce bugs, measure the effectiveness of the workflow and automate things will also be much appreciated.
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                Improving processes that involve many teams, such as this one, is not an easy thing. So we need someone like you—someone with a clear, methodical, analytical mind and the calm efficiency of a Swiss watch!

              <li>
                You are not one to follow a broken process just because someone told you to. You have the empathy and emotional intelligence to dig deep and understand why a process or a team is not working as well as it should. And you love finding ways to fix it.

            <p class="role-content-body">
              DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia. We are
              headquartered in Singapore, with a growing presence in Greater
              China, Southeast Asia and South Asia. <br /><br />

              We were named the Best Bank in the World by Global Finance in
              August 2018—the first Singapore and Asian bank to receive this
              honour.<br /><br />

              We want our customers to <b>Live more, Bank less</b> and we want
              to <b>make banking invisible.</b>

              Every day, there’s a lot more to explore, experience and enjoy—and
              a lot less time to do it in. That’s why we’ve created banking
              that’s fast, natural, effortless. Banking that’s with you wherever
              life takes you, instead of taking you away from life. So you can
              enjoy a lot more life, with a lot less bank.

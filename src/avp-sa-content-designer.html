              <br />

              <li>
                You'll do some competitive research online.

              <br />

              <li>
                You'll analyse data and make data-driven content decisions.

              <br />

              <li>
                Then come the emails and meetings. You'll need to keep up with and summarise the feedback from various stakeholders and follow up to make sure you get the answers you need.

              <br />

              <li>

              <li>
                To make sure your content sees the light of day, you'll need to do some grunt work—updating Figma files and content management systems, participating in demos and checking staging apps.
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                Don't like grunt work? Good, neither do we, so we're constantly trying to improve our tools and processes to make sure we have less of it to do. And we want you to contribute.

              <br />

              <li>
                To summarise, you'll own the customer journey from a copy perspective and make sure there are no gaps in UX across all channels and touchpoints linked to the products.

              DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia. We are
              headquartered in Singapore, with a growing presence in Greater
              China, Southeast Asia and South Asia. <br /><br />

              We were named the Best Bank in the World by Global Finance in
              August 2018—the first Singapore and Asian bank to receive this
              honour.<br /><br />

              We want our customers to <b>Live more, Bank less</b> and we want
              to <b>make banking invisible.</b>

              Every day, there’s a lot more to explore, experience and enjoy—and
              a lot less time to do it in. That’s why we’ve created banking
              that’s fast, natural, effortless. Banking that’s with you wherever
              life takes you, instead of taking you away from life. So you can
              enjoy a lot more life, with a lot less bank.

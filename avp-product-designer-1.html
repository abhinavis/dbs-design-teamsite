                    <p class="role-content-body">You'll spend most of your time trying to simplify very complex products and ideas. It may be an uphill battle, but it's worth it. If you succeed, your designs will be experienced by millions and solve real-life problems. We say that, if you can work in a bank, you can work anywhere. Don't worry, we're a nice bunch of people. Around here, we go out of our way to help one another.</p>

                            <li>You'll spend time with our wonderful research team. Together you'll try to understand the business goals of your project and, often meet the stakeholders to redefine the problem statement.</li><br>

                            <li>Once you know where you're going, it's time to tackle the behemoth tech systems and legal restrictions of a bank. Your product manager will become your best friend. You'll message the tech lead more than your parents. You'll get a crash course in finance law.</li><br>

                            <li>We want to hire people who have opinions, believe in their ideas and are willing to fight for them. But we also want people who can recognise when a better argument or solution is put before them. All of us participate in user testing, and so will you.</li><br>

                            <li>Like we said, producing good work is not good enough if it doesn't get built. We love you, Dribble/Behance. It's not you, it's us. You will meet stakeholders from different departments and articulate your ideas so clearly that you'll become an honorary Toastmaster.</li><br>

                            <li>To prepare for those meetings you'll need to check the latest relevant data.</li><br>

                            <li>Before you know it, it will be Friday and time for team dinner, drinks or Creative Day (we do something fun and creative together once a month).</li><br>

                            <li>You work smart, organised and are ready to improve processes. You can work independently without too many guidance.</li><br>

                            <li>You pay attention to details but also can zoom out and think holistically.</li><br>

                            <li>You have confidence in your ideas and the ability to communicate them clearly.</li><br>

                            <li>You can brainstorm the next big thing one moment and still tweak pixels right before launch.</li><br>

                            <li>You have the ability to prioritise (you don't focus on polishing UI, perfecting prototype or illustrations if the UX looks like a love child between Frankenstein and Krusty the Clown).</li><br>

                            <li>You put great deal attention in your craft without loosing the big picture. You will design the journey and experiences that simple and elegant</li><br>

                            <li>You have enough curiosity to stay savvy about industry and UX trends.</li><br>

                            <li>You follow through—when built, your designs actually look and work like they should. You monitor products after launch and are ready to suggest improvements.</li><br>

                            <li>You're an optimist person. You're team player and can work with more senior or junior designers.</li><br>

                            DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia. We are headquartered in Singapore, with a growing presence in Greater China, Southeast Asia and South Asia. <br><br>

We were named the Best Bank in the World by Global Finance in August 2018—the first Singapore and Asian bank to receive this honour.<br><br>

We want our customers to <b>Live more, Bank less</b> and we want to <b>make banking invisible.</b>

Every day, there’s a lot more to explore, experience and enjoy—and a lot less time to do it in. That’s why we’ve created banking that’s fast, natural, effortless. Banking that’s with you wherever life takes you, instead of taking you away from life. So you can enjoy a lot more life, with a lot less bank.
